# Instructions

Hello, and thanks for taking the time to interview with us at Tracksuit! This is
a take-home exercise we'd like you to complete. This shouldn't be hard and
shouldn't take very long--if it takes more than two hours you're over-thinking
it!

> [!Note] 
> This task is meant to give us something to talk over in your technical
> interview. We're not trying to trick you with something that requires fancy
> algorithms to solve.

## Background

Imagine you are a developer at a promising startup called Suit Tracker Inc. Here
at Suit Tracker, we have a huge network of well-paid interns that hang out at
malls and note down what people are wearing out there in the wild. We then get
our data science team to tell us what it all means, and our office fax is
ringing off the hook with potential customers wanting to sign up to receive our
fashion insights.

Right now we're faxing reports every month to our customers with our findings.
But as we get more and more customers we're having problems keeping up with the
number of reports we have to send out every month.

If only there were a better way. ðŸ¤·

## Solution

We're working on a new feature in our World Wide Web app called _Insights_,
which will allow customers to log in and see what data science has found out,
all without us having to fax anything out at all! We think this is the key to
taking our business to the next level.

## The task

One of our top developers, Chuggs, has been working on it. But we've just found
out they were injured in a terrible interview accident, and we need your help to
get the project over the line.

Before they went under for surgery, Chuggs told us the work was nearly complete
and everything done so far is pretty much flawless. They just had to write two
more endpoints for working with reports--one to create an insight, and another
to delete an insight.

So, we need you to complete those two endpoints. Do it for Chuggs.
